<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The idea of translating Catullus in the original metres adopted by the
poet himself was suggested to me many years ago by the admirable,
though, in England, insufficiently known, version of Theodor Heyse
(Berlin, 1855). My first attempts were modelled upon him, and were so
unsuccessful that I dropt the idea for some time altogether. In 1868,
the year following the publication of my larger critical edition<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of
Catullus, I again took up the experiment, and translated into English
glyconics the first Hymenaeal, <i>Collis o Heliconici</i>. Tennyson's Alcaics
and Hendecasyllables had appeared in the interval, and had suggested to
me the new principle on which I was to go to work. It was not sufficient
to reproduce the ancient metres, unless the ancient quantity was
reproduced also. Almost all the modern writers of classical metre had
contented themselves with making an accented syllable long, an
unaccented short; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> most familiar specimens of hexameter,
Longfellow's <i>Evangeline</i> and Clough's <i>Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich</i> and
<i>Amours de Voyage</i> were written on this principle, and, as a rule,
stopped there. They almost invariably disregarded position, perhaps the
most important element of quantity. In the first line of <i>Evangeline</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>This is the forest primeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>there are no less than five violations of position, to say nothing of
the shortening of a syllable so distinctly long as the <i>i</i> in
<i>primeval</i>. Mr. Swinburne, in his Sapphics and Hendecasyllables, while
writing on a manifestly artistic conception of those metres, and, in my
judgment, proving their possibility for modern purposes by the superior
rhythmical effect which a classically trained ear enabled him to make in
handling them, neglects position as a rule, though his nice sense of
metre leads him at times to observe it, and uniformly rejects any
approach to the harsh combinations indulged in by other writers. The
nearest approach to quantitative hexameters with which I am acquainted
in modern English writers is the <i>Andromeda</i> of Mr. Kingsley, a poem
which has produced little effect, but is interesting as a step to what
may fairly be called a new development of the metre. For the experiments
of the Elizabethan writers, Sir Philip Sidney and others, by that
strange perversity which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> so often dominates literature, were as
decidedly unsuccessful from an accentual, as the modern experiments from
a quantitative point of view. Sir Philip Sidney has given in his
<i>Arcadia</i> specimens of hexameters, elegiacs, sapphics, asclepiads,
anacreontics, hendecasyllables. The following elegiacs will serve as a
sample.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Unto a caitif wretch, whom long affliction holdeth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And now fully believ's help to bee quite perished;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Grant yet, grant yet a look, to the last moment of his anguish,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>O you (alas so I finde) caus of his onely ruine:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dread not awhit (O goodly cruel) that pitie may enter</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Into thy heart by the sight of this Epistle I send:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And so refuse to behold of these strange wounds the recitall,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Lest it might m' allure home to thyself to return.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>In these the classical laws of position are most carefully observed;
every dactyl ending in a consonant is followed by a word beginning with
a vowel or <i>h</i>&mdash;<i>affl&#299;ct&#301;&#335;n holdeth</i>, <i>mom&#275;nt &#335;f h&#301;s anguish</i>, <i>ca&#363;se &#335;f
h&#301;s onely</i>; <i>affliction wasteth</i>, <i>moment of his dolour</i>, <i>cause of his
dreary</i>, would have been as impossible to Sir Philip Sidney as <i>mo&#275;r&#335;r
t&#277;nebat</i>, <i>mom&#275;nt&#259; p&#277;r curae</i>, <i>ca&#363;s&#259; v&#277;l sola</i> in a Latin writer of
hexameters. Similarly where the dactyl is incided after the second
syllable, the third syllable beginning a new word, the utmost care is
taken that that word shall begin not only with a syllable essentially
short, but, when the second syllable ends in a consonant, with a vowel:
<i>&#333;f th&#301;s &#277;pistle</i>, but not <i>&#333;f th&#301;s d&#301;saster</i>, still less <i>&#333;f th&#301;s
d&#301;rection</i>. The other element of quantity is less rigidly defined; for
(1) syllables strictly long, as <i>I</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>so</i>, are allowed to be short;
(2) syllables made long by the accent falling upon them are in some
cases shortened, as <i>r&#365;&#299;ne</i>, <i>p&#277;r&#301;sh&#275;d</i>, <i>cr&#365;&#275;l</i>; (3) syllables which the
absence of the accent only allows to be long <i>in thesi</i>, are, in virtue
of the classical laws of position, permitted to rank as long
elsewhere&mdash;<i>mom&#275;nt of his</i>, <i>&#333;f this epistle</i>. It needs little reflection
to see that it is to one or other of these three peculiarities that the
failure of the Elizabethan writers of classical metres must be ascribed.

reader or a classically trained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> student. The same may be said of the
translation into English hexameters of the two first Eclogues of Virgil,
appended by William Webbe to his <i>Discourse of English Poetrie</i> (1586,
recently reprinted by Mr. Arber). Here is his version of Ecl. I., 1-10.</p>

<p>There are many faults in these verses; over quaintnesses of language,
constructions impossible in English,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> quantities of doubtful
correctness, harsh elisions, for Webbe has tried even elisions. Yet, if
I may trust my judgment, all of them can still be read with pleasure;
the sapphics may almost be called a success. This is even more true of
metres, where these faults are less perceptible or more easily avoided,
for instance, Asclepiads. Take the verses on solitariness, Arcadia, B.
II. fin.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>O sweet woods, the delight &#333;f s&#335;l&#301;t&#257;riness!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O how much I do like your solitariness!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where man's mind hath a freed consideration</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of goodness to receive lovely direction.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or the hendecasyllables immediately preceding,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Reason tell me thy minde, if here be reason,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In this strange violence, to make resistance,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where sweet graces erect the stately banner.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is obvious that a very little more trouble would have converted these
into very perfect and very pleasing poems. Had Sir Philip Sidney written
every asclepiad on the model of <i>Where man's mind hath a freed
consideration</i>, every hendecasyllable like <i>Where sweet graces erect the
stately banner</i>, the adjustment of accent and quantity thus attained
might, I think, have induced greater poets than he to make the
experiment on a larger scale. But neither he nor his contem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>poraries
were permitted to grasp as a principle a regularity which they sometimes
secured by chance; nor, so far as I am aware, have the various revivals
of ancient metre in this country or Germany in any case consistently
carried out the <i>whole</i> theory, without which the reproduction is
partial, and cannot look for a more than partial success. Even the four
specimens given in the posthumous edition of Clough's poems, two of them
elegiac, one alcaic, one in hexameters, though professedly constructed
on a quantitative basis, and, in one instance (<i>Trunks the forest
yielded, with gums ambrosial oozing, &amp;c.</i>) combining legitimate quantity
(in which accent and position are alike observed) with illegitimate (in
which position is observed, but accent disregarded) into a not
unpleasing rhythm, cannot be considered as more than imperfect
realizations of the true positional principle. Tennyson's three
specimens are, at least in English, still unique. It is to be hoped that
he will not suffer them to remain so. Systems of Glyconics and
Asclepiads are, if I mistake not, easily manageable, and are only
thought foreign to the genius of our language because they have never
been written on strict principles of art by a really great master.</p>

<p>What, then, are the rules on which such rhythms become possible? They
are, briefly, these:&mdash;(1) accented syllables, <i>as a general rule</i>, are
long, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> some syllables which count as long need not be accented,
as in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>All that on earth's leas blooms, what blossoms Thessaly nursing,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>blossoms</i>, though only accented on the first syllable, counts for a
spondee, the shortness of the second <i>o</i> being partly helped out by the
two consonants which follow it; partly by the fact that the syllable is
<i>in thesi</i>; (2) the laws of position are to be observed, according to
the general rules of classical prosody: (<i>a</i>) dactyls terminating in a
consonant like <i>beautiful</i>, <i>bounteous</i>, or ending in a double vowel or
a diphthong like <i>all of you, surely may, come to thee</i>, must be
followed by a word beginning with a vowel or <i>y</i> or <i>h</i>; dactyls
terminating in a vowel or <i>y</i>, like <i>slippery</i>, should be followed,
except in rare cases, by words beginning with a consonant; trochees,
whether composed of one word or more, should, if ending in a consonant,
be followed by a vowel, if ending in the vowel <i>a</i>, by a consonant,
thus, <i>planted around</i> not <i>planted beneath</i>, <i>Aurora the sun's</i> not
<i>Aurora a sun's</i> (see however, lxiv. 253), but <i>unto a wood, any again,
sorry at all, you be amused</i>. (<i>b</i>) Syllables made up of a vowel
followed by two or more consonants, each of which is distinctly heard in
pronunciation, as <i>long</i>, <i>sins</i>, <i>part</i>, <i>band</i>, <i>waits</i>, <i>souls</i>,
<i>ears</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>heart</i>, <i>bright</i>, <i>strength</i>, <i>end</i>, <i>and</i>, <i>rapt</i>,
<i>hers</i>, <i>dealt</i>, mo<i>ment</i>, bo<i>soms</i>, <i>answers</i>, moun<i>tains</i>, bear<i>est</i>,
tum<i>bling</i>, gi<i>ving</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> com<i>ing</i>, harbour<i>ing</i>, diffi<i>cult</i>, immi<i>nent</i>,
strata<i>gems</i>, utter<i>ance</i>, happi<i>est</i>, trem<i>bling</i>ly, can never rank as
short, even if unaccented and followed by a vowel, <i>h</i> or <i>y</i>. Thus, to
go back to Longfellow's line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>This is the forest primeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>for&#277;st</i>, <i>murmur&#301;ng</i>, <i>pines &#259;nd the</i>, are all inadmissible.
But where a vowel is followed by two consonants, one of which is unheard
or only heard slightly, as in <i>acc</i>use, sh<i>all</i>, <i>ass</i>emble,
<i>diss</i>emble, kind<i>ness</i>, com<i>pass</i>, <i>aff</i>ect, <i>app</i>ear, <i>ann</i>oy, or when
the second or third consonant is a liquid, as in <i>betray</i>, <i>beslime</i>,
<i>besmear</i>, <i>depress</i>, <i>dethrone</i>, <i>agree</i>, the vowel preceding is so
much more short than long as to be regularly admissible as short, rarely
admissible as long. On this principle I have allowed
<i>dis&#333;rd&#277;rly&#774;</i>, <i>t&#275;n&#259;ntl&#277;ss</i>, <i>heav&#277;nly&#774;</i>, to rank
as dactyls.</p>

<p>These rules are after all only an outline, and perhaps can never be made
more. It will be observed that they are more negative than positive. The
reason of this is not far to seek. The main difference between my verses
and those of other contemporary writers&mdash;the one point on which I claim
for myself the merit of novelty&mdash;is the strict observance throughout of
the rules of position. But the strict observance of position is in
effect the strict avoidance of unclassical collocations of syllables: it
is almost wholly negative. To illustrate my meaning I will instance the
poems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> written in pure iambics, the <i>Phaselus ille</i> and <i>Quis hoc potest
uidere</i>. Heyse translates the first line of the former of these poems by</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Die Galeotte, die ihr schauet, liebe Herrn,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and this would be a fair representation of a pure iambic line, according
to the views of most German and most English writers. Yet not only is
<i>Die</i> no short syllable, but <i>ihr</i>, itself long, is made more hopelessly
long by preceding three consonants in <i>schauet</i>, just as the last
syllable of <i>schauet</i>, although in itself short, loses its right to
stand for a true short in being followed by the first consonant of
<i>liebe</i>. My own translation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The puny pinnace yonder you, my friends, discern,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whatever its defects, is at least a pretty exact representation of a
pure iambic line. xxix. 6-8, are thus translated by Heyse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Und jener soll in Uebermuthes Ueberfluss</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Von einem Bett zum andern in die Runde gehn?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>by me thus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Shall he in o'er-assumption, o'er-repletion he,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sedately saunter every dainty couch along?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The difference is purely negative; I have bound myself to avoid certain
positions forbidden by the laws of ancient prosody. To some I may seem
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> have lost in vigour by the process; yet I believe the sense of
triumph over the difficulties of our language, the satisfaction of
approaching in a novel and perceptibly felt manner one of those
excellences which, as much as anything, contributes to the permanent
charm of Catullus, his dainty versification, will more than compensate
for any shortcomings which the difficulty of the task has made
inevitable. The same may be said of the elaborately artificial poem to
Camerius (c. lv.), and the almost unapproachable Attis (c. lxiii.).
Here, at least half the interest lies in the varied turns of the metre;
if these can be represented with anything like faithfulness, the gain in
exactness of prosody is enough, in my judgment, to counterbalance the
possible loss of freedom in expression.</p>

<p>There is another circumstance which tends to make modern rules of
prosody necessarily negative. Quantity, in English revivals of ancient
metre, depends not only on position, but on accent. But accent varies
greatly in different words; <i>heavy level ever cometh any</i>, have the same
accent as <i>empty evil either boometh penny</i>; but the first syllable in
the former set of words is lighter than in the latter. Hence, though
accented, they may, on occasion, be considered and used as short; as, on
the same principle, <i>dolorous stratagem echoeth family</i>, usually
dactyls, may, on occasion, become tribrachs. But how lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> down any
positive rule in matter necessarily so fluctuating? We cannot. All we
can do is to refuse admission as short syllables to any heavier accented
syllable. Here, then, much must be left to individual discretion. My
translation of the Attis will best show my own feeling in the matter.
But I am fully aware that in this respect I have fallen far short of
consistency. I have made <i>any</i> sometimes short, more often long; <i>to</i>,
usually short, is lengthened in lxi. 26, lxvii. 19, lxviii. 143; <i>with</i>
is similarly long, though not followed by a consonant, in lxi. 36;
<i>given</i> is long in xxviii. 7, short in xi. 17, lxiv. 213; <i>are</i> is short
in lxvii. 14; and more generally many syllables allowed to pass for
short in the Attis are elsewhere long. Nor have I scrupled to forsake
the ancient quantity in proper names; following Heyse, I have made the
first syllable of <i>Verona</i> short in xxxv. 3, lxvii. 34, although it
retains its proper quantity in lxviii. 27. Again, <i>Pheneos</i> is a dactyl
in lxviii. 111, while <i>Satrachus</i> is an anapaest in xcv. 5. In many of
these instances I have acted consciously; if the writers of Greece and
Rome allowed many syllables to be doubtful, and almost as a principle
avoid perfect uniformity in the quantity of proper names, a greater
freedom may not unfairly be claimed by their modern imitators. If
Catullus could write <i>Phars&#259;liam coeunt, Phars&#259;lia regna
frequentant</i>, similar license may surely be extended to me. I believe,
indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> that nothing in my translation is as violent as the double
quantity just mentioned in Catullus; but if there is, I would remind my
readers of Goethe's answer to the boy who told him he had been guilty of
a hexameter with seven feet, and applying the remark to any seeming
irregularities in my own translation would say, <i>Lass die Bestie
stehen</i>.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult to swell this Preface by enlarging on the
novelty of the attempt, and indirectly panegyrising my own undertaking.
I doubt whether any real advantage would thus be gained. If I have
merely produced an elaborate failure, however much I might expatiate on
the principles which guided me, my work would be an elaborate failure
still. I shall therefore say no more, and shall be contented if I please
the, even in this classically trained country, too limited number of
readers who can really hear with their ears&mdash;if, to use the borrowed
language of a great poet, I succeed in making myself vocal to the
intelligent alone.</p>

<p>This line is quoted as Catullus's by Porphyrion on Hor. c. 1. 16, 24.
His words, <i>Catullus cum maledicta minaretur</i>, compared with the last
lines of this poem, <i>Irascere iterum meis iambis Inmerentibus, unice
imperator</i>, seem to justify my view that they belong here. See my large
edition, p. 217, fragm. I. The following line, <i>So may destiny, &amp;c.</i>, is
a supplement of my own: it forms a natural introduction to the <i>Si non
uellem</i> of v. 10.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">LV.</p>

<p>This is the only instance where Catullus has introduced a spondee into
the second foot of the phalaecian, which then becomes decasyllabic. The
alternation of this decasyllabic rhythm with the ordinary
hendecasyllable is studiously artistic; I have retained it throughout.
In the series of dactylic lines 17-22, Catullus no doubt intended to
convey the idea of rapidity, as, in the spondaic line immediately
following, of labour.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">4 <i>You on Circus, in all the bills but you, Sir.</i><br /></span>

<p>There seems to be no authority for the meaning ordinarily assigned to
<i>libellis</i>, "book-shops." I prefer to explain the word placards, either
announcing the sale of Camerius's effects, which would imply that he was
in debt, or describing him as a lost article.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LXI.</p>

<p>In the rhythm of this poem, I have been obliged to deviate in two points
from Catullus. (1) In him the first foot of each line is nearly always a
trochee, only rarely a spondee: the monotonous effect of a positional
trochee in English, to say nothing of the difficulty, induced me to
substitute a spondee more frequently. (2) I have been rather less
scrupulous in allowing the last foot of the glyconic lines to be a
dactyl (-uu), in place of the more correct cretic (-u-).</p>

<p>108. The words in italics are a supplement of my own.</p>

<p>Except in 18, <i>Hilarate aere citatis erroribus animum</i>, 53, <i>Et earum
omnia adirem furibunda latibula</i>, where the Ionic a minore, which seems
to have been the original basis of the rhythm, is preserved intact in
the former half of the line. I have followed Catullus generally with
exactness, but with an occasional resolution of one long into two short
syllables, where it has not been introduced by the poet, <i>e.g.</i> in 31,
34, 49, 64, 65, 68, 79. In v. 10 I have ventured on a license which
Catullus does not admit, but which is, I think, justified by other and
earlier specimens of the metre, an anaclasis of the original Ionic a
minore at the end of the line. In reading this poem it should never be
forgotten that there is a pause in the middle of each line, which
practically divides it into two halves. Tennyson, in his <i>Boadicea</i>,
written on the model of the <i>Attis</i>, divides each verse similarly in the
middle; but in the first half he has changed the rhythm of Catullus to a
trochaic rhythm, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> the second, while producing much of the effect of
the <i>Attis</i> by the accumulation of short syllables at the end of the
line, he has not bound himself to the same strictly defined feet as
Catullus, and generally has preferred to take from the somewhat
emasculate character of the verse by adding an unaccented syllable at
the close.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
